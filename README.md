This repository contains antibody sequences published in our Immunity manucsript: "Precursor frequency and affinity determine B cell competitive fitness in germinal centers, with implications for germline-targeting HIV vaccine design"

The fasta files contain heavy and light chain amino acid sequences of transgenic (Tg) inferred-germline VRC01 (VRC01gHL) cells, dervied from spleenic germinal centers following immunization with eOD GT5-60mer. 

Paring of HC and LC are denoted by the sequence name nomenclature, MXA## where:
  X=sample ID
  A=either H or L, denoting heavy vs light chain
  ##: sample well identifier. 
ex. M7HA8 and M7LA8 are respectively HC and LC sequences of the same BCR.
