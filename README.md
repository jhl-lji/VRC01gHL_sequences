This repository contains antibody sequences published in our Immunity manucsript: "Precursor Frequency and Affinity Determine Competitive Fitness of B Cells in Germinal Centers, As Tested with Germline-Targeting HIV Vaccine Immunogens"

The fasta files contain heavy and light chain amino acid sequences of transgenic (Tg) inferred-germline VRC01 (VRC01gHL) cells, dervied from spleenic germinal centers following immunization with eOD GT5-60mer. 

Paring of HC and LC are denoted by the sequence name nomenclature, XA## where:

X: Mouse identifier. All sequences are from terminal procedures, thus M7 from D8 is a different mouse than M7 from D16. "rM" and "M" also denote different mice.

A: either H or L, denoting heavy vs light chain

##: Location of sample cell in 96 well plate 

ex. M7HA8 and M7LA8 are respectively HC and LC sequences of the same BCR.
